        name: "Earthquake",
        description: "Earthquakes are sudden and violent shaking of the earth's surface caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth's crust. They can range from minor tremors that barely shake the ground to major quakes that can cause catastrophic destruction. Earthquakes occur along faults, which are fractures in the Earth's crust where two blocks of land have moved past each other. The energy released during an earthquake can lead to ground shaking, surface rupture, and secondary effects like landslides and tsunamis.",

Practice 'Drop, Cover, and Hold On' drills with your family. 3. Know how to turn off utilities like gas, water, and electricity. 4. Retrofit your home by reinforcing foundations and securing items.",
        during: "1. Drop to the ground, cover your head and neck, and hold on until the shaking stops. 2. If indoors, take shelter under a sturdy piece of furniture or against an interior wall away from windows. 3. If outside, move to an open area away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires. 4. If driving, pull over to a safe location away from overpasses and bridges.",
        after: "1. Check for injuries and provide first aid as needed. 2. Inspect your home for damage; if you suspect a gas leak, turn off the gas and evacuate. 3. Avoid using elevators and be prepared for aftershocks. 4. Follow updates from local authorities for guidance on safety and recovery.",

        name: "Tornado",
        description: "Tornadoes are rapidly rotating columns of air extending from a thunderstorm to the ground. They can cause extreme damage due to their intense wind speeds, which can exceed 300 mph. Tornadoes form in severe thunderstorms where warm, moist air meets cold, dry air, creating instability in the atmosphere. The strength of tornadoes is classified using the Enhanced Fujita Scale.",
        preparation: "1. Understand tornado watches and warnings. A watch means conditions are favorable; a warning means a tornado has been sighted. 2. Identify a safe location in your home, such as a basement or interior room on the lowest floor. 3. Prepare an emergency kit with water, food, medications, and a weather radio. 4. Reinforce your home with storm shutters and secure outdoor objects.",
        during: "1. Seek shelter immediately in your designated safe location. 2. Protect yourself from debris by covering your head and neck. 3.

        description: "Hurricanes are large, organized systems of thunderstorms with a well-defined circulation pattern that forms over warm ocean waters. They are characterized by strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges. Hurricanes are categorized using the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which ranges from Category 1 (minimal) to Category 5 (catastrophic). They can cause extensive damage through wind, flooding, and storm surge.",
        preparation: "1. Understand your hurricane risk and review local evacuation routes. 2. Create an evacuation plan and ensure your vehicle is ready for travel. 3. Prepare an emergency kit with essentials including water, non-perishable food, medications, a flashlight, and important documents. 4. Secure your home by installing storm shutters, boarding up windows, and reinforcing the roof. 5. Know how to turn off utilities in case of damage.",
        during: "1. Follow evacuation orders and move to a safe location. 2. Stay indoors and away from windows. Keep in touch with family members and stay updated on the stormâ€™s progress. 3.
